    descrp:         The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews.
                    Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products.
                    The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale,
                    representing a positive or negative review, respectively.
                    In order to automatically analyze reviews, the following tasks are executed:
                    - 1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm,
                    the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.
                    - 2. Use classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.
                    - 3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
    to use:         The folder contains the various data files in .tsv format, along with the following python files:
                    - 'project1.py' contains various useful functions and function templates and the written code by author.
                    - 'main.py' is a script skeleton where these functions are called and includes code by author to run experiments.
                    - 'utils.py' contains utility functions that the MITx6.86 staff has implemented.
                    - 'test.py' is a script which runs tests on a few of the methods. These tests are provided by
                    MITx6.86 staff to help debug implementation and are not necessarily representative of the tests.
